# Overview

This program is my introduction into the Kotlin language.

This is a roughly built banking program. The intent for this project was to introduce me to Kotlin's unique aspects, as well as create code that can be integrated into a mobile app for a later project.

# Development Environment

I used the IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate editor to develop the program.

I used Kotlin for the project, and did not employ any non-standard libraries. I used the standard random and datetime libraries for the purpose of my code.
